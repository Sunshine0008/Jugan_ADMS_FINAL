--- ETL PIPELINE FINAL DATA INSIGHTS REPORT ---

INSIGHT 1: TOTAL REVENUE BY COUNTRY
Standardizing all sales into USD allows for a direct comparison of market 
scale. This identifies which country is the primary driver of profit 
independent of local currency fluctuations.

INSIGHT 2: TOP-PERFORMING PRODUCT CATEGORIES
By aggregating data across all branches, we can see which categories 
(like "Electronic Accessories" or "Food and Beverages") have the highest 
global demand. This is essential for inventory and supplier negotiations.

INSIGHT 3: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY CITY
Comparing the "rating" column across cities like Tokyo, Yangon, and 
Mandalay highlights operational strengths. High-performing cities can 
serve as a blueprint for improving lower-rated branches.

INSIGHT 4: MEMBERSHIP VALUE ANALYSIS
Analyzing "Member" vs. "Normal" customer types reveals the effectiveness 
of loyalty programs. It shows if members actually spend more or visit 
more frequently than non-members.

INSIGHT 5: PEAK TRANSACTION HOURS
Using the "time" column to track sales volume by hour identifies 
busy periods. This helps managers optimize staff scheduling and 
time-sensitive marketing promotions.
